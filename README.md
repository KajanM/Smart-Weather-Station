# Smart-Weather-Station
A "work in progress" self-state reporting solar powered weather station with power management which gathers different types of weather data, stores them for future analysis and transmit them periodically to the backend using GPRS.

##Introduction

Records of daily weather conditions have been kept for 200 years and more, of course, but traditionally have always required a diligent and dedicated human observer to record readings from manual instruments at a fixed time, without fail, every single day. And to analyze the daily data collected over months and years, more painstaking paperwork was called for. Smart Weather Station is a solution to this problem. It is a self-state monitoring and reporting solar powered weather station with power management which gathers different types of weather data, stores them for future analysis and transmit them periodically to the backend using GPRS.

##System Functions
•	Senses different environmental values.

•	Completely solar powered.

•	Has full database containing history of the environment (MySQL)

•	Periodic data transmission using GPRS to a back-end database.

•	Self-contained and monitored for brownouts and power issues.

•	Download data to crunch it on the PC

•	Can connect to the IOT via Twitter, texting, e-mail and Wi-Fi.


##Deliverables
•	Standalone battery powered device to act as a weather station with pluggable-modules including rain gauge, temperature, humidity, wind gauge.

•	Data should be stored in an SD card and also transmitted periodically using GPRS to a back-end database.

•	The device should have power management.
